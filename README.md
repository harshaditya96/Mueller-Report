# Mueller-report-Analysis

Main aim is to observe the shift in focus before and after Mueller report is released. Data for this purpose is collected from commmoncrawl, NY times articles and twitter. A Hadoop infrastructure can be successfully implemented due to the humongous amount of data collected. Finally, mapreduce algorithm is run to observe the main topic of focus.
